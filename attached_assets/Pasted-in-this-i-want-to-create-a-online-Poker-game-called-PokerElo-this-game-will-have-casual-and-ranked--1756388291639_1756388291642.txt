in this, i want to create a online Poker game called PokerElo
this game will have casual and ranked 
menu screen:
have buttons: Casual, Ranked, Inventory (Coming soon) Tutorial, and then smaler buttons for Settings, Leaderboards (coming soon), and Stats
have a login / sign up screen too
usernames must be 3-20 characters, unqieu, english only and no spaces
email is optional
password is required
google signup is also allowed, but the site should ask for a username as well
with this, email/password and google login will be enabled on the auth for ifrebase

Game:
both poker casual and ranked need 2-6 players. each player starts wit 500 chips, they can hit stand and all other poker stuff, as well as fold.
The game goes on until one person has all the chips, in which they are the winner. THe poker system uses a final point system to determine elo changes. winner gets most elo, seocnd gets second most elo, third gets third most, while 4-6 get little to none


when a player queues, ahve a queue screen that searcehs for a game for 3-20 seconds (higher elo = higher wait time), realistic queue
poker system shows usernames and such


for ranked:
each season lasts a month (starting on the first of each month), for now we'll have a pre-season system, so season 1 starts on September 1, 2025. and the season number increments each month, with the season at the top of the page on th emenu screen (have a countdown in days and hours and minutes for when a new season starts)
Each season, the players ranks get soft reset (like rocket league), and theyll need to place 5 placement matches for ranked, which will determine their starting rank
Ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold (around 400 ish mmr), Platinum, Diamond, Champion, Grand Champion
Each rank has 3 divisions, expect for Grand Champion (so theres Gold I, II, III, diamond I, II, III, etc)


Season rewards:
we'll have a season reward system. Each time it starts at bronze, they need 10 rakned wins to get to the next season reward, then another 10, up to their current rank. Example: if theyre diamond, highest reward they can get is Diamond until they get to champion and win 10 more times.

ensure to have ui elements to show season rewards, placements, etc

ensurte the site has a dark mode theme
I want this done in html/css/js, do not overocmplicate it.
UI design: modern, techy but appealing to competitive gameplay

Note:
- use a firebase database for the user login and signups, as well as game stuff
- databases should be created dynamically, so when i signup for the first tiem, it creates the databse
firebase skd:
